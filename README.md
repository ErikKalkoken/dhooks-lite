## Description

This is a simple to use API wrapper for posting messages on Discord via webhooks. It is a re-implementation of the popular [dhooks](https://github.com/kyb3r/dhooks) library, but will also work on Python 3.4.x, 3.5.1 and 3.5.2.

Dhooks-lite is interface compatible with dhooks and implements the following subset of  dhook's original functionality:

- Webhook (synchronous calls only)
- Embed
