# dhooks-lite

This is a simple wrapper for Discord webhooks. It's a re-implementation of the popular [dhooks](https://github.com/kyb3r/dhooks) library. But this library will also run on older environment running Python 3.5.2 or Python 3.4.x.

Dhooks-lite is interface compatible with dhooks and provides the following subset of  dhook's functionality:

- Webhook (synchronous calls only)
- Embed
